# GAElections

Simply pulls NYT/Edison data for the Georgia 2020 presidential elections and tracks inconsistencies in the vote counts.  

Finds vote totals and percentage distributions for candidates and calculates votes added.  It then finds any ballot dump that had negative votes added as the total or for any candidate.  Also finds instances in which a candidate received more than the total votes added for a particular ballot dump.

Let me know if I'm missing something.
